architecture:
  overview: |
    Modular toolkit architecture with two main components:
    1. Claude Skills - Self-contained skill packages in .claude/skills/
    2. Claude Delegator Multi - Plugin system for multi-provider AI delegation
  patterns:
    - "Skill-based modularity"
    - "MCP Server pattern"
    - "Multi-provider orchestration"
